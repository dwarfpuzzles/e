    <h3>Hello everyone eggman here and today I will be showing you how to abuse report malwat.ch</h3>
    <h4>First because malwat.ch is behind cloudflare you should report it at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/abuse/form">https://www.cloudflare.com/abuse/form</a><br>Make sure to select Phishing & Malware as the report reason, and enter https://malwat.ch/malware as the Evidence</h4>
    <h4>Second you should report it to malwat.ch's domain registrar directly, which is 1API, their abuse team can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:abuse@1api.net">abuse@1api.net</a> and also report it to <a href="mailto:abuse@hexonet.net">abuse@hexonet.net</a> as 1API is just a reseller of them.</h4>
    <h4>Lastly, feel free to report the domain to your favorite antivirus vendors and security companies, a good list of them can be found <a href="https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-report-malware-or-false-positives-multiple-antivirus-vendors.htm">here</a></h4>
