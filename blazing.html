<h2 id="thesituation">The situation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Andrew has been claiming "Bob Pony" was secretly trying to take down his website (malwat.ch) but was likely him misunderstanding due to the context tweet from @TheBobPony likely caused Andrew to get upset, which was basically a little slipdost for shits and giggles and that meme was made by someone else in case if you're wondering.</li>
<li>Andrew made a series of posts on Twitter, calling out "Bob Pony" for the website take down, but it was actually reported by someone else (Keep in mind anyone can make reports).</li>
<li>Then Andrew would tweet a screenshot of messages from the Discord server which showed a message saying it wouldn't stop the reports (Didn't imply Bob Pony reported it, but meaning others can still report it) since the website still had the content that wasn't taken down.</li>
<li>Streisand effect happened: Other people started to get angry and caused even more drama over it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs:</h2>
<h3>Q. Endermanch said "Bob Pony" has been trying to take down malwat.ch, is this true?</h3>
	<p>A. No, Bob Pony has NOT filled any reports for malwat.ch, but the recent reports were filed by someone else.</p>
	<h3>Q. Did Bob Pony hijacked the domain? (enderman.ch)</h3>
	<p>A. No, the domain was publicly for sale on the web since fall 2019 and the previous owner (Endermanch) has moved to malwat.ch since the expiration of the domain (enderman.ch). The domain (enderman.ch) was legally brought and wasn't stolen from him since the domain was for sale publicly on the internet meaning anyone can buy it.</p>
	<h3>Q. How did Endermanch get that Discord screenshot in his tweet? Didn't he leave Discord?</h3>
	<p>A. Someone was lurking then sent the screenshot to Andrew and he still uses Discord but doesn't have a public Discord server anymore.</p>
	<h3>Q. By the way, what's the source for this website? I wanna take a look at it?</h3>
	<p>A. You may view it on <a href="https://github.com/TheBobPony/e">GitHub</a></p>
	<h3>Q. I've got more questions, that's not in the FAQs!</h3>
	<p>A. Feel free to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/G56uaaUsKD">Discord server</a></p>
<h2 id="endybad">Why Andrew is a bad person</h2>
<ul>
<li>Homophobic (Yes that "ns ns..." username in the photo below is his account, posted in his old Discord server before deletion):</li>
<p class="image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EttQ7g6XMAADcIS?format=jpg&name=small" alt="a screenshot of a bunch of messages proving that he is homophobic" style="width: 650px;" /></p>
<li>Clickbait: for example, his MS-DOS video is just command prompt</li>
<li>He has anger issues which made him to delete the last Discord server without any explanation until a few days later claiming it was the "toxic people".</li>
<li>He also made BS before and tried to cover it up</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don't listen to whatever Andrew says, he's a toxic manipulative liar and will probably make you upset.</p>
<h3>After that image spreaded, he made notsobot tags about us (they're not global anymore)</h3>
<p class="image"><img src="https://dir.lukgth.xyz/endy/endy-big-angry.png" alt="picture showing the noxyntious tag created by Enderman containing simply the word garbage" /></p>
<p class="image"><img src="https://dir.lukgth.xyz/endy/endy-big-angry-2.png" alt="the okame tag simply containing grease ball" /></p>
<p class="image"><img src="https://dir.lukgth.xyz/endy/endy-big-angry-3.png" alt="the yoshiplex tag which simply makes fun of yoshiplex" /></p>
